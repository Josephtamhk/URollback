# URollback
URollback is a rollback networking API which relies on Unity and [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror) for networking.

Due to relying on Mirror, this is a **server/client** based solution. 

## Requirements
* [Mirror](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror)
  * [UDP Transport](https://mirror-networking.com/docs/Transports/index.html) (Examples use LiteNetLib4Mirror)

## Resources
* [Rollback Networking in INVERSUS](http://blog.hypersect.com/rollback-networking-in-inversus/)
* [GGPO](https://github.com/pond3r/ggpo)
